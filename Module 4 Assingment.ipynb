    "Q1)Explain the key features of python that make it a popular choice of programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- Python is a popular programming language. Its features are:\n",
    "a)Python is very easy to learn as compared to other languages like Javascript, Java, etc.\n",
    "b)Python is Object-Oriented programming. Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes, object encapsulation, etc.\n",
    "c)It has huge active community.\n",
    "d)There are many libraries present in python where all optimized and well- written code are already kept.\n",
    "e)It is widely used in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2) Describe the role of predefined keywords in  python and provide examples of how they are used in a program?\n",
    "Ans- Python keywords are special reserved and predefined words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes.Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding. They cannot be used as an identifier, function or variable name.\n",
    "Example: type, else, while, True, False, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example how they are used in program\n",

    "Q3)Compare and contrast mutable and inmutable objects in python with examples?\n",
    "Ans- MUTABLE OBJECTS\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Mutable objects are those that allow us to change their value or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Mutable objects are widely used in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMMUTABLE OBJECTS\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Immutable objects don't allow us to change their value or data.\n",
