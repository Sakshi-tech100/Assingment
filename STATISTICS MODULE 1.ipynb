    "1. Explain the different types of data (qualitative and quantitative) and provide examples of each. Discuss\n",
    "nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans- Data can be divided into two main types: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative data is descriptive and cannot be measured, while quantitative data is numerical and can be counted. \n",
    "Qualitative data can be further categorized into four types: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio: \n",
    "Nominal\n",
    "Categorizes variables into groups using qualitative labels, such as gender or eye color. There is no order or hierarchy to these labels. \n",
    "Ordinal\n",
    "Categorizes variables into groups with a natural order or hierarchy, such as education level or Likert scale responses. However, the intervals between categories are not necessarily equal. \n",
    "Interval\n",
    "A numerical scale with a known, evenly spaced interval between values. Examples include temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit, credit scores, and SAT scores. \n",
    "Ratio\n",
    "A numerical scale with a natural zero point, indicating the absence of the attribute being measured. Examples include height, weight, and duration\n",
    "\n",
    "2.What are the measures of central tendency, and when should you use each? Discuss the mean, median,\n",
    "and mode with examples and situations where each is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans- The 3 most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median and mode.\n",
    "The mode is the most frequent value.\n",
    "The median is the middle number in an ordered data set.\n",
    "The mean is the sum of all values divided by the total number of values.\n",
    "Here's an example of mean, median, and mode for the set of numbers 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9:\n",
    "Mean\n",
    "The mean is the average of the numbers, which is calculated by adding all the numbers together and dividing by the total number of values. In this example, the mean is 5, calculated by adding up all the numbers (2+3+3+4+6+8+9=35) and dividing by 7.\n",
    "Median\n",
    "The median is the middle value in a set of numbers. In this example, the median is 4, because it's the fourth number when the numbers are arranged in increasing order.\n",
    "Mode\n",
    "The mode is the value that appears the most. In this example, the mode is 3, because it appears twice, while the other numbers only appear once.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explain the concept of dispersion. How do variance and standard deviation measure the spread of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans- Basically, it is the square-root of the Variance (the mean of the differences between the data points and the average). Standard Deviation is the measure of how far a typical value in the set is from the average. The smaller the Standard Deviation, the closely grouped the data point are.\n",
    "Dispersion\n",
    "The degree to which a distribution is stretched or squeezed. Dispersion measures are used to determine if data is homogeneous or heterogeneous. \n",
    "Variance\n",
    "A measure of dispersion that takes into account the spread of all data points in a set. It's calculated by finding the mean squared difference between each data point and the mean. \n",
    "Standard deviation\n",
    "A measure of dispersion that's the square root of the variance. It's also known as the root mean square deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is a box plot, and what can it tell you about the distribution of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans- Box plots are used to show distributions of numeric data values, especially when you want to compare them between multiple groups. They are built to provide high-level information at a glance, offering general information about a group of data's symmetry, skew, variance, and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Discuss the role of random sampling in making inferences about populations?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans- Random sampling is a statistical technique that helps researchers draw inferences about a population by selecting a sample from the population at random. This technique allows researchers to make generalizations about a population without having to survey every individual in the population. \n",
    "Here are some benefits of random sampling: \n",
    "Reduces bias: Random sampling removes researcher bias by ensuring that every item in the population has an equal chance of being selected. \n",
    "High internal validity: Randomization helps reduce the impact of confounding variables. \n",
    "High external validity: A large enough sample size can represent the characteristics of the larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of skewness and its types. How does skewness affect the interpretation of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans- Skewness is a statistical measurement of how asymmetric a distribution is, or how much it deviates from a normal distribution. It can be used to describe the distribution of a variable, or to determine if a variable is normally distributed. Skewness can be positive, negative, zero, or undefined: \n",
    "Positive skewness\n",
    "The distribution is longer on the right side of its peak, with values more concentrated on the right and the left tail spread out. \n",
    "Negative skewness\n",
    "The distribution is longer on the left side of its peak, with values more concentrated on the left and the right tail spread out. \n",
    "Zero skewness\n",
    "The distribution is symmetric, with the tails on both sides of the mean balancing out. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the interquartile range (IQR), and how is it used to detect outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans- IQR is the range between the first and the third quartiles namely Q1 and Q3: IQR = Q3 – Q1. The data points which fall below Q1 – 1.5 IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 IQR are outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Discuss the conditions under which the binomial distribution is used.?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans- The number of observations n is fixed. 2: Each observation is independent. 3: Each observation represents one of two outcomes (\"success\" or \"failure\"). 4: The probability of \"success\" p is the same for each outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Explain the properties of the normal distribution and the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule)?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans- The empirical rule states that in a normal distribution, virtually all observed data will fall within three standard deviations of the mean. Under this rule, 68% of the data will fall within one standard deviation, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Provide a real-life example of a Poisson process and calculate the probability for a specific event.\n",
    "ans- The number of customers arriving at a grocery store can be modeled by a Poisson process with intensity λ=10 customers per hour. Find the probability that there are 2 customers between 10:00 and 10:20. Find the probability that there are 3 customers between 10:00 and 10:20 and 7 customers between 10:20 and 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Explain what a random variable is and differentiate between discrete and continuous random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans- A random variable is a variable whose value is unknown or a function that assigns values to each of an experiment's outcomes. A random variable can be either discrete (having specific values) or continuous (any value in a continuous range).\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Provide an example dataset, calculate both covariance and correlation, and interpret the results.?\n",
    "ans- Covariance and correlation are mathematical concepts that describe how two random variables tend to deviate from their expected values in similar ways. The sign of the covariance indicates the direction of the linear relationship between the variables:\n",
    "Positive covariance\n",
    "Greater values of one variable tend to correspond with greater values of the other variable.\n",
    "Negative covariance\n",
    "Greater values of one variable tend to correspond with lesser values of the other variable."
