    "1. Discuss the scenarios where multithreading is preferable to multiprocessing and scenarios where\n",
    "multiprocessing is a better choice.\n",
    "ANS- Multithreading is ideal for tasks that are I/O-bound or require frequent access to shared data, as threads can efficiently communicate and synchronise access to shared resources. Multiprocessing: Best suited for CPU-intensive tasks that can be easily parallelised without frequent inter-process communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Describe what a process pool is and how it helps in managing multiple processes efficiently.\n",
    "ANS- A process pool is a programming pattern for automatically managing a pool of workers. Instead of creating many processes that run and terminate, it can be more efficient to create a fixed number of worker processes and reuse them for a suite of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Explain what multiprocessing is and why it is used in Python programs.\n",
    "ANS- Multiprocessing in Python is a built-in package that allows the system to run multiple processes simultaneously. It will enable the breaking of applications into smaller threads that can run independently.\n",
